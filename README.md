#Week_9_Live_Bus_Tracker
MITxPro This project was a required component of the MITxPro Full Stack Developer Course

<h1>Description</h1>
This program displays a World Map which automatically centers on Boston. The program then tracks a bus on Boston's Route 1. The location of the bus is displayed via a marker and is then updated every 15 seconds. 

<h1>How to Run</h1>
To run this program download the files and place in a folder together. Then drag and drop the index.html file to a browser. Click on the "Update Bus Route 1" button to begin tracking the bus. 

<h1>Roadmap of Future Improvements</h1>

1. Track all buses on Route 1 simultaneously.
2. Create a different marker for each bus on route 1.
